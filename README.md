# angular-quickstart
Angular learning and utilizing docker.

If you wish to run this and you don't have the pre-requisites of node installed for angular you can utilize docker (:whale:).

Install docker and go to a command-prompt and type `docker-compose up`

When the container is up and running you can navigate to `localhost:3000` for the angular app or `localhost:3001` for browsersync in your browser of choice.
